'''
Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
# Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and
only the integer part of the result is returned.

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
